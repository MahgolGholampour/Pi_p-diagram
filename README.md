# Pi-diagram

In this part, Pi versus p is drawn. Pi(which is actually P) and p are two different parameters in a way that if there is an infinity cluster, Pi is 1. As a matter of fact, P is probability of an occupied site to belong to an infinite cluster. However, p is the probability of each site of the square lattice to have a random number between 0 and p.
With some calculation, critical exponents such as nu are found which is our main purpose.
